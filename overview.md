#An Overview

###What is git?

Git is a piece of software that helps organize and track changes to files over time (usually text based files, like code), and helps multiple users work on the same projects, without stepping on each others' toes. Git is run from the command line (by default the [Terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_%28OS_X%29) on Macs and the [Command Prompt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) on PCs), usually by running `git`, followed by another key word, then often followed by various options.

###What is github?

Github is a website (you're on it now!) that provides a visual interface for git, as well as hosting the files that make up a project. *One* version of these files is hosted on github servers, but in almost every case there are many other versions on various other computers. For example, on my computer at work I have a version of these files, and another version on my computer at home. When you follow these tutorials, you'll have your own version(s). As we work on the files, at various times we will sync them up with the "master" version that is on github, by **pushing** the changes we make to github and **pulling** down the changes other users make to the master version.

I go over a few nice github features in [another document](working.md), but most of what we'll talk about is specific to git, not github. Almost all of the functions and commands we talk about are still valid when using services such as [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

Many [open-source software projects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) are hosted on github (or bitbucket and other git hosting services). Most software developers write their code using git, sometimes in public, sometimes in private (charging for private hosting is one way github makes money).

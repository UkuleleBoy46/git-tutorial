# Git Tutorial

An introduction to git, and a place to practice pushing code!

## Contents

The tutorials are split into three pages:
- [An overview of git](overview.md): What is it? Why use it?
- [Getting started](setup.md): Initial steps before you start.
- [Working with git](working.md): How to push code!

(These instructions often asssume you're on a Mac, or using a [unix shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell))

## Resources

Some of these instructions get pretty technical, but I tried to limit the tutorial to what you need to get started on projects here at Urban. There are some other fantastic, more broad git tutorials and resources out there:
- [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) is a longer tutorial, with tons of information.
- Once you're in the swing of things with git, you might want to print out [this git cheat sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) and put it on your wall. Way helpful.
- Many more great tutorials (including those listed above) can be found in [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources/) from the folks at github.com
